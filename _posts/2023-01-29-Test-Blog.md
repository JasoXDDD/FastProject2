Q1:</p>
<p><img src="/FastProject2/images/copied_from_nb/ghtop_images/Mc2Q1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I did not consider that the code would change the max variable after it had already be set, which lead me to ignore the fact that if x is the max, the max would be set to z since y is not the max. In the future, I'll try to look over every line of the code slowly to make sure that I'm not making any oversights.</p>
<p>Q10:</p>
<p><img src="/FastProject2/images/copied_from_nb/ghtop_images/Mc2Q10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I did not see the fact that this question is multi-select, and I saw that B is correct and moved on. In the future, I'll always check if a question is multi-select, as well as read all of the options carefully.</p>
<p>Q42:</p>
<p><img src="/FastProject2/images/copied_from_nb/ghtop_images/Mc2Q42.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I misplaced III as part of the advertising process instead of the designing process. I will make sure to carefully consider if a certain item can be beneficial to an aspect of developing in the future.</p>
<p>Q49:</p>
<p><img src="/FastProject2/images/copied_from_nb/ghtop_images/Mc2Q42.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I forgot that some programs will just be unanswerable with no solutions. I will keep this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="Summary">Summary<a class="anchor-link" href="#Summary"> </a></h2><p>The most pressing problem I have right now is not being careful enough and making mistakes. I will carefully do the problems, as well as checking them over. In addition, I will need to review some of the previous lessons, since as the results reveal, I need to recover some of my informations.</p>
