<p>I did not notice that the response did not state how does the procedure contribute to the original program. I will be sure to avoid this mistake in the future.</p>

<p>I did not notice how the collegeboard also considered how the index value was set for the list of states and used that as part of why they deducted points, I will keep this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="Reflection">Reflection<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reflection"> </a></h2><p>In this week's Scoring, I noticed how sometimes Collegeboard is very lenient with things, and sometimes they are very strict. I will notice in my project to specify how the procedure contributes to the overall program, as well as how the indices for a list is determined. Still, I think I'm getting better at understanding what Collgeboard wants from me in the Create Performance Task, namely,</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear answers that are detailed and specific to what is being asked.</li>
<li>An input that results in the programâ€™s output and explain how</li>
<li>Have a list or lists that is used effectively to reduce the complexity</li>
<li>Describing how indices of a list is being determined by.</li>
</ul>
