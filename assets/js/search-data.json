            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review of variables in the introduction last week. String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some of the types of variables. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) #string is a primitive # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) #int is a primitive # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) #float is a primitive print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) #list is a collection print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) #element in this list in a primitive print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) #dictionary is a collection print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) #string in dictionary is primitive . name John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 18 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[0] Python &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;John Doe&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 18, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Haoxuan&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Tong&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;July 9&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;haoxuantong8@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) InfoDb = [] InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Haoxuan&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Tong&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;July 9&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;haoxuantong8@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [] }) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Calling a for loop with index . Instead of using elements, using the function range can create a list of indexes to output the data. . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for i in range(len(InfoDb)): #Using range(len(InfoDb)) to create an iterable of indices print_data(InfoDb[i]) for_loop() .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
