    "The video and the written response do not demonstrate a creative purpose but merely restating the function of the program. The Input and the Output os also not clearly seperated in the purpose, giving it a 0. Data abstraction is apparent with the effective use of lists. The Code is not complex, and the response does not explain why it was complex. The algorithm of the evaluateGuess function uses the variable guess, but it is also used outside of the funciton. The response does not indicate why the algorithm demonstrate complexity. The algorithm demonstrates iteration, sequencing, and selection, but its description is not clear enough for it to be replicated. However, the program did demonstrate testing, with one wrong answers and win conditions, as well as clear description of what's being tested.\n",

The written response demonstrates that information is stored in one list, without any overflowing of variables, and also shows how it is used. The code does a good job with managing complexity here, with the use of wordlist to manage the words and use them. The program clearly shows a procedure and how it is used well. The procedure shows sequencing, selection(if), and iteration(while), and includes a detailed explanation of the procedure enough to recreate it from just the description. The program describes in detail what both testing sequences is used for and what happens in the program as those were run. All of this combined gives it a perfect score with 6/6\n",
