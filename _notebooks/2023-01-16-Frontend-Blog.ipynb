    "The view is made from a mix of html and javascript. The Insert New Food Item part can have inputs that can be used to create a food item and all of its nutrients. The button is linked to a javascript function that will place the food item into a backend server, which will then place the items into the table below. Currently this function still does not work, since this is still a prototype. In the future, I will try to make sending of the json to and from the backend server available."
